# Brain Tumor Classification

## Aim
This project uses ML and CNN in order to classify if the image of Brain MRI (top) scan has tumor or not.

## Resources
The data can is available as zip file 

## Description 
The binary classification of Brain Tumor MRI scans is obtained using a CNN model. The Image generator for the model undergoes Image augmentation before being given as input. The final accuracy obtained is 58 percent. The low accuracy is obtained due to absence of proper hyper parameter tuning and better model architecture.

Below are some image predicted correctly.
